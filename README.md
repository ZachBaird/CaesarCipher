# Caesar Cipher
This Ruby script contains a method that accepts a string and number as arguments. The string is then changed per the cipher by the number value passed into the method.

## Tech Requirements

* Ruby 2.7.0
* RSpec

## How to Use

1. Clone the repository and `cd` into `caesarcipher`
2. Run `rspec`
3. Write any additional test inputs you want to test and rerun `rspec`

## Notes

I had initially wrote this script without any unit tests. The old code was kept in `lib/old`. The new, test-driven code sits in `lib`.
